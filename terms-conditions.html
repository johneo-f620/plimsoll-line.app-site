            <p>These terms and conditions apply to the Plimsoll Line app (hereby referred to as "Application") for
                mobile devices
                that was created by Factory 620 LLC (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It
                is strongly
                advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.</p><br>
            <p>Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is
                strictly
                prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into
                other
                languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights,
                and other
                intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as
                possible. As
                such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for
                any reason.
                The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly
                communicated
                to you.</p><br>
            <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in
                order to provide
                the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the
                Application. The
                Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing
                software
                restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could
                expose your
                phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result
                in the
                Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>
            <div><p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and
                Conditions. Below
                are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the
                Application:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://adapty.io/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adapty</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some
                functions of the
                Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
                provider.
                The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity
                due to lack of
                access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p><br>
            <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network
                provider's
                agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data
                usage during the
                connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept
                responsibility for
                any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your home
                territory (i.e.,
                region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
                you are
                using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.</p><br>
            <p>Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application.
                For instance,
                it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery
                and you are
                unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.</p><br>
            <p>In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to
                note that while
                they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to
                provide
                information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability
                for any
                loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of
                the
                application.</p><br>
            <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently
                available as per
                the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the
                availability of
                the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using
                the
                application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that
                it is
                relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device.
                However,
                you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also
                wish to
                cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination
                notice to you.
                Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in
                these terms
                will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.</p>
            <br><strong>Changes
            to These Terms and Conditions</strong>
            <p>The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to
                review this
                page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new
                Terms and
                Conditions on this page.</p><br>
            <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-11-25</p><br><strong>Contact Us</strong>
            <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about the Terms and Conditions, please do not hesitate to
                contact the
